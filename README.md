# Predicting-Hazardous-NEOs-Nearest-Earth-Objects-
This project involves training a machine learning model to predict whether a Near-Earth Object (NEO) is hazardous based on NASA's dataset (1910â€“2024). The dataset contains 338,199 records of monitored space objects, some classified as hazardous. Accurate predictions are crucial for planetary defense.
